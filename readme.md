## Learning React Intermediate
This project is a list of notes and examples as I bring myself up to speed on intermediate concepts in ReactJS.

Here I will be using tools like Webpack, Babel and JSX. The entire code structure was built from scratch and I am not going to use any boilerplates to set this up.

## Setup
yarn install

## Build
node_modules/.bin/webpack

## Run
node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --colors --progress --watch
